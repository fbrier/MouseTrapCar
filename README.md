# MouseTrapCar
Kim and I are working on a fun mouse trap car project. This is the source code for the Arduino that will control the car.
We are starting out with sketch files, but plan to move the code into classes soon.

## Build Instructions
Since I own CLion, having it might be helpful, but you can probably just build with CMake. However, if you do use CLion,
this project was built using the [CLionArduinoPlugin](https://github.com/vsch/CLionArduinoPlugin).

##ToDo:
Pull in IR library using [Arduino CMake](https://github.com/queezythegreat/arduino-cmake)
